    <p>"party 4 u" (stylized in lowercase) is a pop/hyperpop song by Charli XCX, produced by A. G. Cook, released on her 2020 album how i'm feeling now. The song explores themes of unrequited love, anxiety, and vulnerability, focusing on throwing a party for someone who never arrives.</p>

    <p>
Party 4 u is written about a particular ex-boyfriend of Charli’s - Mike Kerr of the band Royal Blood. Rumors are that the relationship was pretty toxic from all sides. The song is pretty literal: she throws a party hoping he’ll show up and he never does. The song is about all the things they will do together if he does arrive but Charli’s delivery lets you know that deep down she knows she’s about to get her heart broken.

         <h3>Everything is romantic</h3>
    <p>"Everything is romantic" is a song from Charli XCX's 2024 album Brat that explores finding beauty, love, and intimacy in mundane, everyday moments while traveling. Co-produced by A. G. Cook and El Guincho, the track uses vivid imagery like "lemons on the trees" and "white sheets of lace" to create a dreamy, reflective atmosphere. </p>

    <h3>Track 10</h3>
    <p>"Track 10" is the highly acclaimed, chaotic, and emotional closing song from Charli XCX's 2017 mixtape *Pop 2*. It is a radically reworked version of her demo "Blame It on Your Love," featuring production with heavy synth, metallic, and experimental elements, and is considered a definitive "Charli 2.0" track. </p>

    <p>
“Track 10” is a remix of the previously unreleased song “Blame It On Your Love,” making it the only song on the project that wasn’t specifically made for this mixtape. Confusingly, the original track was later remixed with a feature from Lizzo and released as a single in May 2019.

    <h4>Why Charli?</h4>
    <h2>Charli xcx, the original BRAT.</h2>
    <p>
She first broke through in the early 2010s after writing and featuring on *“I Love It”* with Icona Pop, followed by her debut album **True Romance** (2013), which already showed her taste for darker, internet-native pop. Mainstream success came with **Sucker** (2014) and hits like *“Boom Clap,”* but instead of staying in that lane, she deliberately swerved.

From 2016 onward, Charli became a central figure in **hyperpop and experimental pop**, collaborating with producers like SOPHIE and A.G. Cook. Projects like **Number 1 Angel**, **Pop 2**, and **Charli** cemented her reputation as an artist’s artist—hugely influential, deeply online, and more interested in shaping the future of pop than chasing radio formulas. During lockdown, she released **How I’m Feeling Now**, a raw, DIY album made almost entirely in isolation, which became a fan favourite.

Her later work, including **Crash** and **Brat**, balances mainstream pop with her experimental instincts, proving she can top charts *and* stay culturally disruptive. Today, Charli XCX is widely seen as one of the most influential pop artists of her generation—someone who consistently defines what pop will sound and look like next rather than reacting to trends.

        <h3>About this website</h3>
        <p>
           I created a website dedicated to Charli XCX that celebrates her sound, visuals, and chaotic-pop energy through bold interaction and playful design. It’s a space where fandom meets experimentation, using dynamic layouts and immersive details to reflect her ever-evolving aesthetic while letting me explore the intersection of music, culture, and code.   This project was coded by Natalie Kiel and is <a href="https://github.com/nkiel2511/charli-xcx" target="_blank">open sourced</a>.

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I’m 30, based in Glasgow, Scotland, and work in interaction design while teaching myself full-stack coding. I’m driven by curiosity, building things that feel as good as they function, and constantly pushing my skills beyond design into development. When I’m not thinking about interfaces and code, I’m probably obsessing over Charli XCX—because great pop and great design both know how to hit hard and stay memorable.
